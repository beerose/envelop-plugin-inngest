  Thanks [@dthyresson](https://github.com/dthyresson)! - Setup function now supports fan out jobs.

  `yarn inngest-setup-redwoodjs function -t fan-out'

  Sometimes you might need to trigger new functions from existing functions, for example when youâ€™re
  developing a complex workflow or performing work for more than one object (eg. a group of users,
  products, orders). You can achieve this via fan-out, which:

  - Allows functions to call other functions, which run in parallel
  - Makes your workflows more reliable, as each function has its own retries and will fail
    individually on permanent errors
  - Provides insight and tracing, allowing you to see the relationships between functions

  See: https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/fan-out-jobs

  ## Breaking Changes

  Setup functions are no longer default exported:

  ```
  const loadCronJob = inngest.createFunction()

  default export loadCronJob
  ```

  is now

  ```
  export const loadCronJob = inngest.createFunction()
  ```

  This was done so that it would be easier to register multiple functions from the same file which
  was needed to support fan out functions.

  For example:

  ```ts
  import { serve } from 'inngest/redwood';
  import helloWorld from 'src/jobs/inngest/helloWorld';
  import { loadCronJobFanOut } from 'src/jobs/inngest/loadCronJob';
  import { loadCronJob } from 'src/jobs/inngest/loadCronJob';
  import { onCar } from 'src/jobs/inngest/onCar';
  import { onCarDelete } from 'src/jobs/inngest/onCarDelete';
  import { INNGEST_APP_NAME } from 'src/lib/inngest';

  // Add your Inngest functions here
  const inngestFunctions = [helloWorld, loadCronJob, loadCronJobFanOut, onCar, onCarDelete];

  // Serve your Inngest functions
  export const handler = serve(INNGEST_APP_NAME, inngestFunctions, {
    servePath: '/inngest',
    /**
     * The minimum level to log from the Inngest serve endpoint.
     *
     * Default level: "info"
     */
    logLevel: 'info',
    /**
     * A key used to sign requests to and from Inngest in order to prove that the
     * source is legitimate in Production.
     *
     * You must provide a signing key to communicate securely with Inngest. If
     * your key is not provided here, we'll try to retrieve it from the
     * `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable.
     *
     * You can retrieve your signing key from the Inngest UI inside the "Secrets"
     * section at {@link https://app.inngest.com/env/production/manage/signing-key}. We highly recommend
     * that you add this to your platform's available environment variables as
     * `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`.
     *
     * If no key can be found, you will not be able to register your functions or
     * receive events from Inngest.
     *
     * Note: This is not required for local development.
